## âœ¨ Highlights & Achievements
- **Qualified** for ISRO IRoC-U 2025 with the **Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle (ANAV)** project.  
- **2nd Prize**, AgriTech category â€” NIT Patna Tech Fest (Agribot project).  
- Designed a **low-cost 2D position-sensitive muography detector** (5Ã—5 CsI + SiPM) and validated it with cosmic rays and a 2.01 GeV electron beam.  
- Internship at **Technology Innovation Hub (IIT Jodhpur)** â€” implemented Jetson-based YOLOv8 object-tracking, PX4/MAVROS integration, and WebXR teleoperation.  
- Co-authored a CERN Beamline for Schools proposal and performed experimental reliability analysis on radiation effects.

## ðŸ’¼ Experience 
**Technology Innovation Hub (TiH), Drishti Foundation â€” IIT Jodhpur**  
*Summer Intern (May 2025 â€“ Jul 2025)*  
- Implemented UAV leader-follower formation using ArUco detection; improved coordination accuracy by ~30%.  
- Deployed YOLOv8 and PX4 pipelines on Jetson (C++ / Python / Docker).  
- Built WebXR teleoperation for a Kinova Gen3 manipulator (WebSockets, WebRTC).

**National Institute of Technology Patna**  
*Robotics Intern (Jan 2025 â€“ Present)*  
- Research on vision and control: SLAM/EKF sensor fusion, real-time detection, and automated data collection pipelines for RL.

**Robotics Club, NIT Patna**  
*Project Team Lead (Nov 2023 â€“ Present)*  
- Led 8-member team; agile development of field-ready prototypes; mentoring on ROS2, OpenCV, and embedded systems.

## ðŸ“Š How I work / Development Practices
- **Modular code** (separate perception, control, and communication modules).  
- **Dockerized** CI-friendly development for reproducible Jetson deployments.  
- **Test-first** approach: validate in SITL/Gazebo before field tests.  
- **Calibration-first**: build LUTs and baseline corrections for sensor systems (SiPM / camera).  
- Use of Git, code reviews, and unit tests where applicable.
